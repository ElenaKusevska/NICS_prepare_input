This program works in the following way:

1) It finds the center of the ring
2) It moves the molecule so that the center of the ring is at
      the origin.
3) It uses multivariate regression with x and y as the independent and
      z as the dependent variable to find the best linear fit for a
      plane passing through all the atoms that make up the ring
4) It finds a normal to the plane of the ring centered at the origin
5) It normalizes the normal to a length of 1
6) It places the dummy atoms at the (normal(0), normal(1), normal(2)) and
      the (-normal(0), -normal(1), -normal(2)) positions, as well as
      at (0,0,0)
7) It aligns the normal with the z-axis. Now the dummy atoms are at
      (0,0,1), (0,0,0), and (0,0,-1).

This approach works much better. It's easier to check if the resulting
geometry is correct (just looking at the coordinates for the dummy
atoms will confirm this). And it works for all molecules regardless of
whether they are symmetric or not.
