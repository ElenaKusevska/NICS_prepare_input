This program works in the following way:

1) It finds the center of the ring
2) It places the center of the ring at (0,0,0)
3) If the ring is symmetric and planar, it is an oblate to
      and therefore two of the principal components of the inertia tensor
      will lie in the plane of the ring, and one will be normal to the
      plane of the ring. So, the program diagonalizes the inertia tensor
      gettinf three normalized eigenvectors corresponding to the three
      principal components of the inertia tensor
4) It identifies the eigenvector that is normal to the plane
5) Aligns this eigenvector to the z-axis
6) Now the ring is in the xy plane and perpendicular to the z-axis
7) It places the dummy atoms at (0,0,1), (0,0,0) and (0,0,-1)

IMPORTANT: This doesn't work well if the ring is not trully symmetric.
